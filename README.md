# 🐶 Animated Dog Face – Interactive CSS & JS Fun!

Welcome to the **Animated Dog Face** project! This is a fun, interactive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays a playful cartoon dog 🐕. Move your mouse around to see the dog's face and eyes follow your cursor, and click anywhere to make it **bark** and wiggle its head! 🐾🎉

## 💡 Features

- 🐾 **Interactive Dog Face**: The dog tilts its head and follows your cursor around the screen.
- 👀 **Eye Tracking**: The pupils follow your mouse movements for a more lifelike effect.
- 🐶 **Barking on Click**: Clicking the screen makes the dog bark and perform a cute wiggle animation.
- 🎨 **Custom Styling**: Built entirely with custom CSS for a unique cartoon look.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- 🎵 Audio (MP3)
